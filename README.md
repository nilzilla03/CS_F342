This was completed as part of coursework for CS F342 Computer Architecture. The goal was to implement a 4 stage multicycle MIPS processor in verilog that would run the 
instructions "SW" and "SLT". 

In particular, the following instructions were executed:
1. 0000 SLT reg1, reg2, reg3
2. 0004 SW reg4, 3 (reg5)


The register files were initialized with the following data

1. reg2 = 35A45
2. reg3 = 11AB0
3. reg4 = 2B124E
